Pour ce projet j'ai utilisé 2 API :
    - PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/)
    - Swapi, Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/)

## Features
- POKEAPI
    2 buttons are presented to you, the first is to restart the random draw of 2 pokemons, and the 2nd is to start the fight.
    the pokemon that turns green is the winning pokemon
    the pokemon that turns red is the losing pokemon
    if no color is displayed it means that there is no winner you have to start a 2nd fight
- SWAPI
    - Star Wars character list (the api does not provide an image :( )
    - if you click on a character the information on his planets of birth will appear.
